# Team Gen-X Plan

## **Pre-trained and Fine-tuned Resources**

### **Pre-trained Resources**
These are being directly used without additional fine-tuning:  

#### **General Chatbot Functionality**
- **Mistral**:  
  - Generates general responses for non-medical queries.

#### **Feature Extraction**
- **BERT-based Emotion Classifier**:  
  - Identifies user emotions like urgency or stress.
- **Gemma**:
  - For Highend Text Based Classification Writing Emails.
- **Med7**:  
  - Extracts medical terms (e.g., diseases, symptoms, medicines).
- **UMLS (Unified Medical Language System)**:  
  - Maps medical concepts to standardized terms.
- **TF-IDF**:  
  - Extracts keywords from user queries to associate with symptoms or medicines.
- **DrugBank API**:  
  - Provides drug-related information like dosage and interactions.
- **Google Search API**:  
  - Enriches responses by searching for medicines and symptoms.

#### **Document Processing**
- **Tesseract OCR**:  
  - Extracts text from scanned images (e.g., prescriptions).
- **PyPDF2 and docx**:  
  - Extract text from PDF and DOCX files.
- **DrugBank and RxNorm**:  
  - Verifies dosage and drug details.

#### **Map and Location Services**
- **Geolocation API**:  
  - Fetches user location for nearest doctor searches.
- **Leaflet.js**:  
  - Displays doctor locations on an interactive map.

#### **Email Sending**
- **SMTP.js**:  
  - Sends emails with patient details and attachments.

### **Fine-tuned Resources**
These are models youâ€™re customizing for specific medical chatbot tasks:

#### **Medical Responses**
- **BioGPT**:  
  - Fine-tuned for medical knowledge, symptom assessment, and treatment information.
- **ClinicalBERT**:  
  - Fine-tuned for understanding medical language in conversations.
- **PubMedBERT**:  
  - Fine-tuned for biomedical text understanding and research-based content.

#### **Conversation Summarization**
- **BioGPT**:  
  - Fine-tuned to summarize conversations for doctor emails and PDF generation.

#### **Prescription Summarization**
- **BioGPT**:  
  - Fine-tuned for summarizing medical prescriptions when requested.

#### **Doctor Recommendations**
- **UMLS**:  
  - Pre-trained, but used to map user symptoms to doctor specialties.
